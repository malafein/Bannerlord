These scripts are intended to be run from their own module directory (Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\ModuleUnblocker)

ModuleUnblocker.bat will only unblock files in the folders from custom mods.  This is the script I recommend you use.

ModuleUnblockerAll.bat will unblock files in all the module folders, including those from TaleWords.
This will run slower, but if you are using mods that alter the contents of those directories, then it may be useful in your case.

Enjoy!
